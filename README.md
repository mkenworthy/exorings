These are Python tools for displaying and fitting giant extrasolar planet ring systems,

Download from github with git pull or the zip file.

Test that you can get the first display window working, then head on
over to the [Exorings wiki](../../wiki/Home) and follow the [Quick Start](../../wiki/Quick-Start) instructions, known issues with the
exoring code, and known issues with the exoring model.
